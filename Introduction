# Credit-card-fraud-detection-
In modern day bankingit is vbery important for banks to isolate the good customers from bad.
to do these they implement many costly measures and human resource also this makes the customers unhappy with so much KYC's being done
this is the reason banks lose valuable customers at the same time they might get prone to give service to defaulters.
hence some measure has to be taken at the organisational level. so the bank employees people with high skills in analytics and
prediction to get a very accurate prediction of defaulters.
 We get this dataset from kaggle this dataset had  the data of credit card holders and they were sorted as defaulters or not defaulters.
 we need to take this data as input and make a model which can predict the customers based on their performance
 We used the SVm Classifier as it is the best model so far as it gave accuracy of 84 percent
